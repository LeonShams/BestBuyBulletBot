Best Buy Bullet Bot, abbreviated to 3B Bot, is a stock checking bot with auto-checkout created to instantly purchase out-of-stock items on Best Buy once restocked. It was designed for speed with ultra-fast auto-checkout, as well as the ability to utilize all cores of your CPU with multiprocessing for optimal performance.

* Headless item stock tracking

* Multiprocessing and multithreading for best possible performance

* One-time login on startup

* Ultra-fast auto-checkout

* Encrypted local credentials storage

* Super easy setup and usage

Bear in mind that 3B Bot is currently not equipped to handle a queue and/or email verification during the checkout process. If either of these is present, the bot will wait for you to take over and will take control again once you are back on the traditional checkout track.

Like `fairgame <https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/fairgame>`_, 3B Bot was created to help level the playing field by giving your average gamer a fighting chance against greedy scalpers. Getting started with 3B Bot was designed to be as easy as possible and shouldn't take more than a couple of a minutes.
