Installation
============

Installing 3B Bot is as simple as running the following in your shell (Command Prompt for Windows and Terminal for MacOS)

For MacOS:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade 3b-bot

For Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade 3b-bot

This same command can be used for updating to the newest version once released.

If the installation fails please go back and make sure you have correctly completed the second step in the prerequisites. If the error persists please report the issue in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/LeonShams/BestBuyBulletBot/issues>`_.
